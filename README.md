# ccmux — Claude Multiplexer

A terminal-based orchestrator for managing multiple [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) agents working on tasks in parallel. Provides a unified tmux-backed interface to spawn, monitor, intervene with, and manage concurrent AI agents across git projects.

Each agent gets its own git worktree, branch, and tmux window — so multiple agents can work on different tasks in the same repo without conflicts.

ccmux is designed to not interfere with users' current Claude Code setups. Spawned agents will respect existing Claude .MD's and additional agent prompting is kept to a minimum.

## Setup (Linux x86_64)
```bash
# Install system dependencies
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y git tmux jq

# Install GitHub CLI
(type -p wget >/dev/null || (sudo apt update && sudo apt-get install wget -y)) \
  && sudo mkdir -p -m 755 /etc/apt/keyrings \
  && out=$(mktemp) && wget -nv -O$out https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg \
  && cat $out | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg > /dev/null \
  && sudo chmod go+r /etc/apt/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg \
  && echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null \
  && sudo apt update && sudo apt install gh -y

# Authenticate with GitHub (needed for private repos and PR operations)
gh auth login

# Install Claude Code
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Install ccmux
gh release download --repo colby-duke-ai/ccmux -p 'ccmux-linux-amd64'
chmod +x ccmux-linux-amd64
sudo mv ccmux-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/ccmux
```

## Optional: Fast Worktrees

For large repos, worktree creation can be slow. Install [proj](https://github.com/Applied-Shared/proj) to enable near-instant worktree creation via reflink copy. Once `proj` is on your PATH, ccmux will offer to set up fast worktrees automatically when adding a project. For repos already imported with `proj import`, ccmux auto-detects and enables fast worktrees.

## Quick Start

1. **Start a session:** `ccmux` (or `ccmux <name>` for a named session).

2. **Register a project:** Press `p` to open project management, then `a` to add a git repository.

3. **Spawn an agent:** Press `n`, select a project and base branch, describe the task. ccmux creates a worktree and launches Claude Code.

4. **Monitor and work the queue:** As agents work, items appear in the quick action queue. Press `q` to pop the top item and take action:

   - 💤 **Idle** — agent's terminal has gone quiet (may be stuck). Jump in to check on it or send it a message.
   - ❓ **Question** — agent explicitly asked for help. Read the details and respond.
   - 🔀 **PR Ready** — agent opened a pull request. **`a`**ccept (merge + cleanup), **`c`**omment (resume agent to address feedback), **`r`**eject (close PR + cleanup), or **`b`**rowser (open in browser).
